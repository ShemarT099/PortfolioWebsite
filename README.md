# PortfolioWebsite
This repository holds code and build functions for a prototype website built using the django framework and written using Python, Html5, CSS and JavaScript.

This is also a beginner attempt at a creation of a portfolio website that would provide a little bit of information about myself, my skills, programming lanaguages and a few projects that have been completed.  
There would also be a page which features a mini-blog. A blog that covers topics about football that i've written in my spare time.

Templates for each page of the website are stored in the portfolio/website/templates folder and is written in html5. 
All html files in the ...website/templates/ folder, "extends" from the base.html file which can be found in the portfolio/templates folder.

BootStrapCSS was used as the primary CSS framework
